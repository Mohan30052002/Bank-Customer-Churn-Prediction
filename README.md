# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction
Developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn in an imbalanced dataset, with a focus on reducing customer attrition.
Utilized the SMOTE to address the class imbalance by generating synthetic data for the minority class (churned customers).
The machine learning model successfully identified potential churners, which helps the bank in taking proactive retention measures.
